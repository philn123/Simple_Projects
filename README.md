# Simple Projects

This will be a collection of simple projects that I use for my hobbies.

## D20 - Dice Roller
A simple program that creates a small window that rolls a single D20 die for Dungeons and Dragons. Included is the `.exe` and the source file.

## ROBOCOPY GUI
A program created in Python with PyQt5 that allows the user to select a source path and a destination path and copies from source to destination with Robocopy. Included is a folder with the `.exe` inside.
